<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This Italian tiramisù recipe is easy to whip up, this version is made with cooked (instead of raw) eggs, and it tastes just as indulgent and delicious as ever.</p>
<p>Who does not love an easy no-bake dessert?  That is one of the best things about this tiramisu recipe.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<div>
    <p>Ladyfingers</p>
    <p>Mascarpone: it wouldn’t be true tiramisu without mascarpone, but if you absolutely must, you could substitute cream cheese.</p>
    <p>Coffee: I use espresso</p>
    <p>Heavy Whipped cream</p>
    <p>Granulated Sugar</p>
    <p>Vanilla extract: or substitute imitation vanilla</p>
    <p>Cocoa powder: for dusting on top</p>
</div>

<h3>Method</h3>

<ol class="meth">
    <li><strong>Mix creamy filling:</strong> Beat the mascarpone, cream, sugar, and vanilla together until stiff peaks.</li>
    <li><strong>Dip lady fingers:</strong>Add the espresso and liqueur (if using) to a shallow bowl and dip the lady fingers on both sides (don’t let them soak–just a quick dip!)</li>
    <li><strong>Layer mascarpone:</strong>Smooth a layer of the mascarpone/whipped cream mixture on top of the lady fingers.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat:</strong>Add another layer of lady fingers (dipped in coffee and liqueur) and another layer of cheese mixture. Dust with cocoa powder.</li>
</ol>
