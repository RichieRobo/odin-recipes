    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>This mushroom risotto is cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so worth it.</p>
    <p>Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting into it.</p> 
    <p>should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <div>
        <p>6 cups chicken broth, or as needed</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</p>
        <p>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>2 medium shallots, diced</p>
        <p>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</p>
        <p>½ cup dry white wine</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons butter</p>
        <p>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol class="meth">
        <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
